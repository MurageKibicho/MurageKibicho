### Murage Kibicho (He/Him/His) ðŸ‘‹
### Hello, my name is Murage Kibicho. I am a Statistics major interested in computer graphics. When I'm not coding you'll find me running at the Payne Whitney track or completing a Duolingo lesson while cycling at the gym. Lol I spent 3 years of my Yale education trying to major in Chinese and Hebrew. My favorite programming languages are shown below.
